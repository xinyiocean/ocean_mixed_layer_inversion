### This is a code package for the training and inverting processes of a U-Net model specifically for northwest Pacific MLD inversion. ###

Main codes for training and inverting are given.
Required classes and functions are given in folders "classes" and "tools", respectively.
Required example files are given in folders "cdl" and "_mask".

Case4.1 is selected as an example for detailed setting, where oceanic inputs and MLD are originated from HYCOM, winds are originated from CFSv2.

Containing: 
1) unet_train.py
	model training
2) unet_invert.py
	inverting with a trained model
3）classes
	containing net modules (net_blocks.py, net.py) and training modules (dataset.py, normalizer.py)
4) tools
	containing functions for universal using (pre_function.py) and model training (torch_function.py)
5) cdl
	containing an example cdl file descriping output nc file, which is used by unet_invert.py (HYCOMnwp_mld.cdl)
6) _mask
	containing an example mask file, which is used by unet_invert.py(HYCOMnwp_mld_mask.nc)
